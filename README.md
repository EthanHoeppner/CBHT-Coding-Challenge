A webapp for displaying JSON data in a table

This is a simple webapp, built using jquery but otherwise vanilla javascript, html, and CSS, for displaying JSON in an HTML table. In addition to the basic requirements, this webapp includes some simple CSS styling features, and displays additional information about the statistics of a user's scores when the score is hovered over.

To run this app locally, clone or download this repository. In the directory where you put the files, start a local http server, then access that server from a browser.

One way to start such a server is by using Python 3. After navigating to the directory containing the files in a command prompt, type the command `python -m http.server`. Then, in a browser, navigate to the URL `http://localhost:8000/`, and you should see the webapp running.
